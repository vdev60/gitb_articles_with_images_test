# Articles with Images

This repository contains a subset of our Ruby on Rails app. There are 3 models.
`Articles` are a type of `Posting`. Other types of Postings include `Questions` and `ProductReviews`. 
Postings have a `body` attribute, which is the body of the Article, Question or Review. 
The text of the Posting is stored as raw html. Some Postings have images embedded within the text of the body, in the form of an `<img>` tag wrapped in `<figure>` tags.

Throughout the site, Posting "snippets" are displayed. A snippet is the first few lines of the Posting. 
They include links to read the full Posting, whether it's an Article, Question or Product Review.  

The repo also contains one view file for displaying a "snippet" and a single spec file.

## The Task
The product manager has decided that 
when displaying a Article "snippet" and the article contains images, the first image should be displayed above the snippet body. 
If an Article contains multiple images, only the first image should be displayed.
